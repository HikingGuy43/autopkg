Shared Processors
======

This readme will give a short description for each processor and which recipes the processor is used in.  This is for usage examples and my own sanity if I update one and don't remember where all I've used it.


## AutoDeskPatchProcessor ##

This processor finds the URL for the latest patch of the supplied major version of an AutoDesk product.  Should support all products and major versions.

Used in:

## CFBundleInfo ##

Supply a path to a plist file, which can point to a path inside a .dmg which will be mounted, and will returns four output_variables, which you can decide how to use:
  * CFBundleVersion
  * CFBundleShortVersionString
  * CFBundleIdentifier
  * version (CFBundleShortVersionString)

Used in:
  * com.github.mlbz521.pkg.RealVNCViewer
  * com.github.mlbz521.pkg.VOSviewer


## ConditionalUnarchiver ##

This process provides a condition wrapper around the Core Unarchiver Processor.

If extraction is needed, it uses Unarchiver to do and then (optionally) uses the FileFinder Processor to locate an extracted file.

If extraction is not needed, the processor simply assigns the %pathname% env variable to the value of the %found_filename% env variable.

Used in:
  * com.github.mlbz521.download.CanonPrintDriver


## ExtractWith7z ##

This processor extracts files with a specified 7zip binary.

Input Variables:
  * archive_path
    * description:  Path to an archive.  Defaults to contents of the 'pathname' variable, for example as is set by URLDownloader.
    * required:  False
  * destination_path
    * description:  Directory where archive will be unpacked, created if necessary. Defaults to RECIPE_CACHE_DIR/NAME.
    * required:  False
  * purge_destination
    * description:  Whether the contents of the destination directory will be removed before unpacking.
    * required:  False
  * 7z_path
    * description:  Path to a 7z-compatible binary.  This does not ship with macOS, it will need to be installed manually. The processor will prioritize a provided binary, but if it cannot locate it, it'll continue trying to find a 7z-compatible binary in common locations, including the system PATH.
    * required:  False

Used in:
  * com.github.mlbz521.download.MaplePatch
  * com.github.mlbz521.pkg.MatlabUpdate


## FileMode ##

This processor essentially runs `chmod` on a file.  Provide the numeric mode for file in octal format.

Used in:
  * com.github.mlbz521.pkg.Anaconda
  * com.github.mlbz521.pkg.SPSSStatisticsLegacy
  * com.github.mlbz521.pkg.SPSSStatisticsPatch


## FindFileInSearchPath ##

Borrowed and customized the find_file_in_search_path function from [JSSImporter.py](https://github.com/jssimporter/JSSImporter/blob/master/JSSImporter.py).  Searches search_paths for the first existing instance of path.  Searches, in order, through the following directories until a matching file is found:
  1. Path as specified.
  2. The parent folder of the path.
  3. First ParentRecipe's folder.
  4. First ParentRecipe's parent folder.
  5. Second ParentRecipe's folder.
  6. Second ParentRecipe's parent folder.
  7. Nth ParentRecipe's folder.
  8. Nth ParentRecipe's parent folder.

This search-path method is primarily in place to support using recipe overrides. It allows users to avoid having to copy templates, icons, etc, to the override directory.

**I added additional functionality to support storing files in a sub directory of the recipes parent directory.**

Used in:
  * com.github.mlbz521.pkg.JamfProTools
  * com.github.mlbz521.jss.PhETLabSimulations
  * com.github.mlbz521.pkg.PhETLabSimulations


## InputVariableTextSubstituter ##

This processor substitutes character(s) in a string with either another string or the value of a set autopkg variable and then returns the modified string as a supplied variable.

I wrote it to be able to substitute values into an input variable for when you want to use, for example the version in an input variable, but the version variable has not been set yet, not until the (child) recipe runs.  However, it can be used to substitute strings in any other strings.

Used in:
  * com.github.mlbz521.jss.ARCHICAD
  * com.github.mlbz521.jss.ARCHICADPatch
  * com.github.mlbz521.jss.AutoCAD

## JVMVersioner ##

This processor finds the Java Virtual Machine version in a JDK package.  This will allow you to use which OpenJDK distribution you would like, and get the JVM version from it.  This can this be used in a Smart Group to point to an EA of the JVM's value, for instance.

Used in:
  * com.github.mlbz521.pkg.AmazonCorrettoOpenJDK


## OfflineApps ##

This was designed for applications that are behind a login or not available via normal internet "acquisitional" methods.

This processor allows you to simply drop the vendor provided "media", in the format they provide, into a specifically named directory and the processor will be able to determine which version of the content to "download," even if multiple versions are available.  

The processor originally expected the vendor content to be organized in sub-directories like `<Software Title>-<version>`, however, this is no longer required and the media can be stored in the root of the specified directory, but the naming convention **must** match or problems will occur.

The specified directory can be local to the AutoPkg runner or on a remote host that will be mounted.  _Before_ "downloading" the processor checks the file size and because it subclasses `URLDownloader`, it uses `cURL` to "download" files.
  * Currently the SMB mount logic uses the process in JSSImporter
    * This prerequisite will be removed in the near future
  * _Recommended:_  The SMB server input variables values can be set in your autopkg prefs file instead of in every recipe

This processor was based on work by:

## StringRightSplitter ##

This processor splits a string starting from the right. Uses the "rsplit()" function.

The processor will verify that the occurrence and index input variables are integers and if not, set them as integers.  This was done since most people use key/string pairs and not key/integers.
